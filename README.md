# Wake-UP Corp 🛸

*"We're UP to something!"*

Wake-UP Corp is a comedy God Simulator/Paranormal Management game where you play as a newly hired employee in a mysterious corporation whose mission is to "wake up" humans to the truth that they live in a simulation (though why anyone would want simulated beings to know they're simulated remains a corporate secret above your pay grade). 

As a rookie agent on probation, you're assigned to a small Bulgarian village - because hey, if things go wrong there, who's really going to notice? Your task is to create various paranormal phenomena to make the residents question their reality, all while dealing with standard corporate bureaucracy. Think "The Office" meets "X-Files", but with more paperwork.
